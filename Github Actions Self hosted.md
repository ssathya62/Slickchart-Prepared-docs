## Introduction

Most tutorial I see online for Github actions are for build and testing and if at all the CD part is included its for installing the application in Azure environment. In my case I want to deploy on my own virtual machine (could be on Azure, AWS, GCP, or any other provider). This document is create as I follow tutorials around the web and compile it into one that will work for me.
